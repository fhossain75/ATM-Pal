# ATM-Pal
UGAHacks 6 (Feb. 2021) Project Submission

1st for Capital One's challenge for “Best Financial Hack”
3rd for NCR Corporation's challenge for developing a disruptive and innovative solution that solves NCR’s most significant problems for banks

To minimize the spread of #COVID-19, speed up the tedious process, and minimize the chances of being in danger, my team developed ATM-Pal, an innovative approach to redefining the conventional process of going to an ATM.

With ATM-Pal, a visit to the ATM starts on a phone using our app, where users securely link their bank account, select a nearby ATM, initialize a withdrawal or deposit, and ATM-Pal then generates a QR code that you present at the ATM to complete the transaction. The ATM uses this QR code information to process the user's transaction without requiring the user to prepare these tasks at the ATM - making the process completely contactless, quicker, and safer.
